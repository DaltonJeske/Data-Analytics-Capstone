The Data Analytics Capstone course was exactly as it sounds, a capstone demonstrating all I have learned throughout the course of my program. The course competencies include: Analyze data, Query data, Perform ETL, Create reports and visuals, Communicate with stakeholders, adn Build data analytic academic portfolio. The attached files demonstrate the final reports and dashboard that I created for this class. These were created from scratch by performing ETL, creating and populating a database, and creating the reports/dashboard you see.
